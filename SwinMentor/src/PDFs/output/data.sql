Generated with DeepSeek with Prompt: 'I have got 50 PDFs just like the onew I have attached to this message. All are in the same format, and the name is same as well. The filename of the PDF just specifies the Degree Code (for example BA-CYB)
 I want you to extract key information like Degree Name (for example Bachelor of CyberSecurity), Units in Each Semester (For example: Semester 1: Network Administration, Network Switching and Routing, ICT Project, etc.). 
And this all needs to be saved in a format I can easily upload to my SQL database. So ideally i need in this format:
Column Heads:
Degree Code | Degree Name | Semester | Core Units | 
Examples:
("Ba-CYB", "Bachelor of Cybersecurity", "1", "Network Administration")
("Ba-CYB", "Bachelor of Cybersecurity", "1", "Network Switching and Routing")
("Ba-CYB", "Bachelor of Cybersecurity", "2", "Introduction to Programming")
("Ba-CYB", "Bachelor of Cybersecurity", "3", "Network Security and Reselience")

I understand that the PDF only specifies semester in 1 AND 2. Please understand that the semester is numbered as Year 1 - Sem 1 Sem 2. Then, Year 2 - Sem 1 Sem 2 becomes Sem 3 and Sem 4. There maybe Sem 1-6(in a 3 year degree) or Sem 1-8 (in a 4 year degree).
I want you to extract all this data in the specified format, including the elective units as "Elective".
Please start with the first file and Please go on to the next file automatically. Please do not stop to say Explanation or Next Steps. Just keep processing all the documents until youre finished'
